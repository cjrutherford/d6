    <h2>What's a Daily 6 or Daily 4 ?</h2>
    <p>
      A Daily 6 is a set of six tasks to complete each day, while a Daily 4 is a
      shorter version with just four tasks. Both are designed to build a pattern
      of Self compassion, mindfulness, and emotional resilience. They exercise
      your ability to reflect on your day in a structured, non-judgemental, and
      supportive way

        <h2>What is DBT?</h2>
        <p>
        Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy
        that focuses on teaching skills to help individuals manage their emotions,
        cope with stress, and improve their relationships. It was originally developed
        to treat borderline personality disorder but has since been adapted for use
        with a variety of mental health issues.
